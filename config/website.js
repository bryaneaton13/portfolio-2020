Software Engineer who creates solutions.
A software engineer who creates technical solutions to solve problems.

I am a co-founder for multiple technology solutions startups. My
          responsibilities have included development,
          architecture/infrastructure, maintenance, customer support, and sales.
          I mostly focus on Javascript applications all the way through backend,
          frontend, and mobile. I also support clients in their need for
          high-quality applications that need to be built out quickly. With over
          10 years of experience doing web development, I can bring my expertise
          to you.
